Install from Play Store
=======================

Ametan is available for installation on the `Google Play Store`_.

Install APK from Github
=======================

To install the latest release of Ametan, download the .apk from the
`project releases`_. Once downloaded, it can be installed through the installation
manager.

.. note::
   Android, by default, disables installing .apk files from outside the Play
   Store. You will need to disable this by enabling Settings -> Security ->
   Allow installation of apps from unknown sources. You can re-enable this
   setting after Ametan is installed, if you wish.
